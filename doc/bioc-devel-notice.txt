Hi Bioconductor Developers,

Big news! We are planning to migrate from SVN to git. This is a major change in
our version control model. We know this will be disruptive to some of our
long-term developers.

Git has really emerged as a modern replacement to SVN, and is widely used in the
bioinformatics community. Many Bioconductor packages are maintained primarily on
git and perhaps the majority of commits to our SVN repository are from git. Git
encourages broad community participation in development of both Bioconductor
infrastructure and contributed software / experiment data packages. Recent
developers of new packages have been using git and Github for their package
development, and this has worked very well for both developers and core team
reviewers. Our current git / svn solutions are very complicated to use.

We are producing robust scripts to create git repositories of each package in
our current SVN repository. The git repositories contain the complete commit
history for 'devel', and for all releases as branches. Details for interaction
with our git server, including the role of github, are still being finalized.

More information about the specifics of the transition plan will be announced in
the middle of March. We anticipate a fully functional 'beta' version available
for broad testing immediately after the next Bioconductor release, in
mid-April. Once we are confident in the new repositories and work flows, we will
switch to an exclusively git-based version control model; SVN will remain
available as a 'read only' resource for as long as is feasible.

We welcome all feedback during this test period; please respond to this post
with comments, or contact nitesh.turaga@roswellpark.org directly.

Best,

Nitesh Turaga
